# Heat pump Monitor software setup

When the Heat pump Monitor first powers up it will create a WIFI access point. Check for this access point in the WIFI networks list on your computer. The network name will likely start with AI-THINKER or ESP. Connect to the access point and navigate to **192.168.4.1**

Select the WIFI network you wish to connect the Heat pump Monitor up to and enter the WIFI passkey. If the connection is successful the IP Address of the heat pump monitor on the local network will be shown. Click on this IP Address to use it then disconnect your computer from the access point and reconnect as normal to your home router. Navigate to the IP Address of the heat pump monitor as found in the last step.
